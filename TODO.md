# TODOS

## Tasks:
- search product from (build database of products)
- score should be the same for each product event after many scanned
- redesign screen of ingrediant list and make it easy to read
- Issue: Same products get different scores over time or between devices
- No Product Comparison: Can't compare multiple products side by side
- Limited Search: Can't search by product name without premium
- No Manual Barcode Entry: Must physically scan, can't type barcode numbers
- Missing Alternatives: Often no alternative product suggestions when something is rated poorly
- Incomplete Information: Many products not in database or missing key information
- Incorrect Data: Wrong ingredients, nutritional values, or product classifications
- Slow Updates: User-submitted corrections take too long to be implemented
- Poor Interface: Difficult navigation, especially for left-handed users
- Language Barriers: Products with non-French labels not properly recognized
- Overwhelming Negativity: Almost everything seems to be rated as "bad"
- make delete account easy to do
- add note to users that app make recommendations by AI not advice health or something
- When a product scores poorly, instantly suggest 3-5 better alternatives available nearby
- Partner with Middle Eastern health authorities and halal certification bodies

## Issues:
- [ ] website for application contains:
    - [ ] privacy policy

- [ ] Github actions (build apk for android studio, and for IOS and add it to play store and apple store, testing, linter format)
  

## **Core Improvements to Your Solution**

**2. Multi-Modal Scanning (Major Competitive Advantage)**
- **QR + Barcode + Photo recognition**: Yuka only does barcodes - you can scan product photos, ingredient lists, even blurry images
- **Online shopping integration**: Let users scan products from e-commerce websites, not just physical stores
- **Bulk scanning**: Scan multiple products at once for grocery trips

**3. Enhanced AI Analysis with OpenAI**
- **Explainable scoring**: Don't just show a number - explain WHY each ingredient affects the score
- **Trend analysis**: "This product has 3x more sodium than similar items"
- **Health impact summaries**: "May trigger acne for sensitive skin" or "High sugar content may affect blood glucose"

## **Competitive Differentiation Strategy**

**Arabic Market Focus = Huge Opportunity**
- Yuka has **zero Arabic language support** - you can own this entire market
- Include halal/haram ingredient detection for Muslim consumers
- Local ingredient databases for regional products

**Technical Superiority**
- **Offline mode that actually works** (Yuka's fails constantly)
- **Real-time price comparison** across local stores
- **Shopping list integration** with recommended alternatives
- **Family sharing** - parents can set restrictions for children's accounts

## **Revenue Model (Learn from Yuka's Success)**

**Freemium Approach**:
- **Free**: Basic scanning, simple scores, 5 alternative suggestions/month
- **Premium ($2.99/month)**: Unlimited alternatives, personalized health profiles, ingredient concentration data, family accounts, price tracking

**Why This Beats Yuka**: More value in free tier, better premium features, lower price point

## **Technical Architecture Recommendations**

```
Frontend: React Native (iOS/Android)
Backend: Node.js/Python
AI: OpenAI GPT-4 + custom health models
Database: PostgreSQL + Redis cache
Image Processing: Computer Vision APIs
Barcode/QR: Multiple scanning libraries
```

## **Go-to-Market Strategy**

**Phase 1**: Arabic markets (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt)
- Partner with local influencers and health bloggers
- Integrate with Carrefour, Lulu, Spinneys apps
- Focus on family health and halal compliance

**Phase 2**: English expansion
- Target health-conscious millennials frustrated with Yuka
- Emphasize scientific accuracy and personalization
- Partner with nutritionists and dermatologists

## **Key Features That Will Beat Yuka**

1. **Smart Shopping Lists**: AI suggests healthier meals based on family preferences
2. **Health Journey Tracking**: Monitor how product choices affect health goals
3. **Community Reviews**: Real user experiences, not just algorithmic scores
4. **Doctor Integration**: Share scan history with healthcare providers
5. **Price Intelligence**: Find the healthiest option within your budget

## **Critical Success Factors**

- **Build credibility early**: Partner with certified nutritionists and dermatologists
- **Focus on accuracy**: Yuka gets criticized for fear-mongering - be science-based
- **Superior UX**: Make scanning faster and more intuitive than Yuka
- **Local relevance**: Understand regional health concerns and food preferences
