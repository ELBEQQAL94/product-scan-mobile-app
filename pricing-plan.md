Looking at the data, let me break this down clearly:

## Cases That Force Account Creation (Based on User Complaints)

### **What Yuka Forces (Why Users Leave):**
- **Basic scanning** - Users must create account just to scan products
- **Viewing product information** - Can't see any product details without account
- **Accessing any app features** - Complete lockout without registration

### **What Should NEVER Force Account Creation:**
- ❌ Basic product scanning
- ❌ Viewing product ratings/information  
- ❌ Setting health profiles
- ❌ Getting product recommendations
- ❌ Comparing products

### **What COULD Reasonably Require Account (Optional Features):**
- ✅ **Cloud backup/sync** across devices
- ✅ **Sharing product lists** with family/friends
- ✅ **Contributing product data** to community database
- ✅ **Premium analytics** (detailed health tracking over time)
- ✅ **Customer support** for complex issues

## Pricing Analysis from Yuka Data

### **Yuka's Current Pricing (User Complaints):**
- **Premium**: €15/year minimum
- **"Prix libre"**: Claims "pay what you want" but minimum is €10-15
- **Users feel deceived**: Expected true "pay what you want" pricing

### **What Premium Includes (That Users Want for Free):**
- Search functionality
- Offline scanning
- Unlimited history
- Product recommendations
- Barcode-free lookup

### **User Price Sensitivity Insights:**
- Many users **expect core features to be free**

```
✅ Unlimited product scanning
✅ Basic health profiles (local storage)
✅ Product ratings & information

```

## Key Pricing Insights from Data:

1. **Users abandon apps that paywall basic features**
2. **€15+ is perceived as expensive** for food scanning
3. **Free alternatives exist** - must offer significant value
4. **Transparency matters** - no "fake" free pricing
5. **Convenience features** (sync, backup) are acceptable premium features

**Bottom Line**: Make the core app genuinely useful for free, charge only for convenience and advanced features. This approach would directly address the #1 complaint against Yuka.
