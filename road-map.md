**Absolutely YES - focus on improvements first, not the website.**

Here's why this is critical:

## **The Product-First Priority**

**Yuka's lesson**: They built a viral product FIRST, then created marketing materials. Their website came after they had millions of users who loved the core experience.

**Your current solution gaps**:
- Basic QR scanning (competitors do barcode + photo + text)
- Simple scoring (users want explanations and alternatives)
- No personalization (major competitive weakness)
- Limited language support (huge Arabic market opportunity)

## **Why Website Can Wait**

**1. No Users = No Conversions**
- A beautiful website for a mediocre app converts nobody
- Users download apps based on functionality, not marketing sites
- App store ratings and word-of-mouth matter 100x more than websites

**2. Resources Are Limited**
- Website development takes 2-4 weeks
- That same time could add multi-modal scanning or personalization
- Every day you're not improving the core product, competitors get ahead

**3. Validation First**
- You need to prove people actually want YOUR specific improvements
- Test with family/friends using a basic app version
- Get feedback on Arabic support, AI analysis quality, alternative suggestions

## **Recommended Sequence**

**Phase 1 (Next 4-6 weeks): Core Product Excellence**
1. Multi-modal scanning (QR + barcode + photo)
2. Better AI analysis with explanations
3. Arabic language support
4. Basic alternative product suggestions
5. Personalization profiles

**Phase 2 (After product validation): Growth Infrastructure**
1. Polish UI/UX based on user feedback
2. App store optimization
3. Basic landing page (not full website)
4. Social media presence

**Phase 3 (After proven traction): Marketing Website**
1. Professional website with features showcase
2. Blog content for SEO
3. Partnership pages
4. Full marketing funnel

## **Quick Reality Check**

Ask yourself:
- Would YOU use your current app over Yuka today? 
- Can you show it to 10 people and get "wow" reactions?
- Does it solve problems Yuka doesn't?

If not, website won't help. **The product IS your marketing.**

## **Minimum Viable Website (If You Must)**

If you absolutely need web presence now:
- Single landing page with app download links
- 3-4 key differentiators vs Yuka
- Email signup for updates
- Takes 1-2 days max, not weeks

**Bottom line**: Yuka succeeded because they built something people couldn't stop using and sharing. Your website won't matter if the app isn't 10x better than theirs.

Focus 90% on product, 10% on marketing until you have clear product-market fit.
